# Hot Takes #

This is the Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

## How to make it work ##

My recommendations:

Create a NEW FOLDER

### For the frontend ###

Into the NEW FOLDER, clone this repository --> https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6

This repository is the project's FRONTEND.

Once cloned, from the root of the frontend's folder

Open a terminal (linux/mac) or Powershell (Windows) and

run `npm install`

Once installed, to launch the frontend

run `npm start`

### For the backend ###

Into the NEW FOLDER, clone my repository.

My repository is the project's BACKEND.

Once cloned, from the root of the backend's folder you'll have to :

- Create a file named `.env` that contains :

`DATABASE = your MongoDB connection string`
`TOKEN = your super secure token`

- Create an empty folder named `images`

- Open a terminal (linux/mac) or Powershell (Windows) and

run `npm install`

once installed, to launch the backend

run `npm start`

Server will listen on port 3000 by default, you can change it by adding `PORT = the port number you want to use` in the .env file

It will automatically connect to your mongoDB database too.
