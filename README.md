# Hot Takes#

This is the Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

# To make the frontend work:

First you'll have to download the frontend part here --> https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6 and follow the instructions.

# To make the backend work:

In the backend root folder:

- Create a .env file that contains :

`DATABASE = your MongoDB connection string`
`TOKEN = your super secure token`

- Create an images folder

Then, from the backend root folder :

open a terminal (linux/mac) or Powershell (Windows) and

run `npm install`

once installed, to launch the backend

run `npm start`

Server will listen on port 3000 by default, you can change it by adding `PORT = the port number you want to use` in the .env file

It will automatically connect to your mongoDB database too.
